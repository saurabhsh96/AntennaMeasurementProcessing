# AntennaMeasurementProcessing
The code deals with processing of data obtained from antenna measurements and determining various parameters

The data obtained by placing AUT in anachoic chamber in given configurations was given.
The matlab codes process this data along with given S parameter data and the gain data to obtain the various parameters 
of the antenna array such as coupling gain etc. (Details in code Q1)
